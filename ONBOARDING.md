## Preliminaries ##

Before continuing, If you haven't already, please review the [README](README.md), the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) and the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) documents as they provide information that is important to getting started and to maintaining the FarmData2 community.

## Tools ##

There are a few key tools that are central to working with the FarmData2 project

#### GitHub ####

The [FarmData2 project repository](https://github.com/DickinsonCollege/FarmData2) is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/), and is likely where you found the code, and this file :smile:.

If you are not familiar with GitHub they have a [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) introduction that will get you started.  After that you'll want to be sure you are familiar with the _GitFlow branching workflow_ [[Intro](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) | [Details](https://githubflow.github.io/)]. An outline of GitFlow steps as it is used in FarmData2 can be found in the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#workflow) document.

#### git ####

FarmData2 uses [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and for implementing the parts of GitFlow that you do on your development machine (e.g. `branch`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `merge`). If you are not yet familiar with git, the [7 Steps to Get Started with Git](https://www.fosslife.org/7-steps-get-started-git) covers the essentials you need to know work with an existing open source project.  The [Git Immersion](https://gitimmersion.com/) tutorial walks through a series of short hands-on exercises that will give you practice with the key features of git. The [Pro Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) or the [Learn Git Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/git/index.htm) provided more detailed and comprehensive coverage. An outline of the use of git (within GitFlow) as it is used in FarmData2 can be found in the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#workflow) document.

#### Zulip ####

The FarmData2 community uses [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) as it communication platform. It is a group chat application that blends the benefits of asynchronous threaded discussions (e.g. a forum) with live chat. Zulip is relatively easy to use once you understand the key ideas of [streams and topics](https://zulip.com/help/about-streams-and-topics).  The [Zulip Home Page](https://zulip.com/) has a quick tour of the features that you can click through and there is also a full set of [User Documentation](https://zulip.com/help/).

Be sure to connect with the [FarmData2 community](https://farmdata2.zulipchat.com/) on its Zulip site.
