 * Note that the file must have at least one selected addition or deletion,
 * ie it's not supported to use this method as a general purpose diff
 * formatter.
 *
 * @param file  The file that the resulting patch will be applied to.
 *              This is used to determine the from and to paths for the
 *              patch header as well as retrieving the line selection state

 * @param diff  The source diff
