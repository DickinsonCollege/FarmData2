# Deletes all of the Transplanting logs and possibly the Planting assets.

# Most transplantings rely on existing Plantings from traySeedings
# By default those Plantings are not deleted.  
# This allows the addTransplantings.py script to be run again.
# However, plantings created for directly transplanted crops that arrived in trays
# will be deleted by default, because they are recreated by the addTransplantings.py script.

# Addng the command line argument "all" will cause this script to also 
# delete the preexisting Planting assets from the traySeedings.
