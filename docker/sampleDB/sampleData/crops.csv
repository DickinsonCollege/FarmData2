# Sample Data for the Farm Crop Families.
#
# Each line contains the name of a farm crop family.
#
# Format:
#
# A left justified line creates a term in the Farm Crop Families vocabulary.
#   These Families are based on the USDA Organic Integrity Database
#   https://organic.ams.usda.gov/integrity/About.aspx
#
# A line beginning with a single comma:
#   Creates a term in the Farm Crop/Varieties vocabulary,
#   and links it to the Farm Crop Family that it appears under.
#
# A line beginning with two commas:
#   Creates a term in the Farm Crop/Varieties vocabularly with
#   the name being PARENT-CHILD (e.g. ONION-SPRING)
#   and sets its parent to the crop that it appears under 
#   (i.e. ONION is the parent of ONION-SPRING)
# 
# While this may seem strange to prepend the parent name, the issue
# that arises otherwise is there are duplicate names in the vocabulary
# (e.g. BEANS-DRY, CORN-DRY)
# 
# The line for each crop contains a comma delimited list with the following:
#   - default units
#   - a list of conversions for the crop (if any), each with 3 values:
#      - new units - the name of the unit to convert to from the default.
#      - factor - the conversion factor.
#         - default value * factor = quantity in new unit.
#
# Crop families appear in farmOS in the oder listed in this file.
# Crops appear in farmOS in alphabetical order in their families or overall.
#
# Any line starting with # is a comment.
# Blank Lines are ignored.
