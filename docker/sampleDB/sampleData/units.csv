# Defines the Units that can be assigned to logs

# Format:
# Each row defineds a unit.  
# The parent items (e.g. Count, Weight) correspond to the different 
# "measures" that can be used in quantity blocks.
# The sub-types (e.g. Beds, Row Feet) begin with a , and define 
# the values that can be used for the "Unit" field of a quantity block.
#
# Having parent types will allow us to show only the appropriate ones
# for a given quantity (e.g. only Counts etc...) as appropriate.
