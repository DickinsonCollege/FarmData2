# This code is added to the end of the .bashrc file
# in the fd2dev account in the development environment
# container.  It ensures tha the fd2dev user is in the
# docker group anytime a terminal is opened.

# It uses the GID of the docker group on the host to ensure
# that the fd2dev user is in a group with GID.  If the user
# is already in the group then nothing is done.  If the user
# is not in the group the a new shell process is started
# to replace the current one, but with the user in the group. 

# Then if the user is not in the fd2grp another shell is started
# to ensure that the user is in that group.  

# The end result is that when a terminal is opened the fd2dev user 
# will be in both the fd2dev group and the docker group.  
# Also, the default group for fd2dev will be fd2grp which ensures 
# that new files are created with the proper group permissions.
