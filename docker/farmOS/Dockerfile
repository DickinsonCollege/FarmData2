# Builds a custom farmos image that includes the patch to the
# restws module that allows for query parameters to use relational
# operations (e.g. [le], [gt], etc)  Note that the .patch file used
# has been modified locally and differs from the one on the Drupal 
# site at: https://www.drupal.org/project/restws/issues/1910294

# NOTE: If changes are made here that require a new image
# update the tag in docker-compose.yml for force the rebuild
# when main is updated.
