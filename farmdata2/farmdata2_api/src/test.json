Crop production records include seeding, transplanting, harvest, cover crop, compost, fertilization, irrigation, pest scouting, and spray activities. Livestock production records track animals from birth to slaughter or sale and include pasture moves, periodic and veterinary care and logging of egg production. Records of packing, distribution and customer invoicing are also maintained. All records and reporting features are designed to closely align with organic certification requirements and to support the certification and recertification process.",
