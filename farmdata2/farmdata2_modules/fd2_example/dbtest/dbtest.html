<div id="dbtest" v-cloak> 

    <p>Unlike other sample modules, this sample module does not have content here.
    Instead, the dbTest sample module consists of a number of <code>.spec.js</code> 
    files that illustrate common patterns used in tests that 
    interact with the database. The contents of those files should be reviewed
    their comments read and studied.  In addition, the tests can be run in 
    the Cypress Test environment.</p>

    <p>Each of the files has comments describing what they are doing.  It is recommended
    to study the files in the order below as later examples may not include comments
    describing things that are documented in an earlier example.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>dbtest.maps.spec.js</li>: Shows how to get maps (e.g. userToIDMap) from the database and use them in tests.
        <li>dbtest.get.seedings.js</li>: Shows how to get seeding logs from the database and use them in tests.
        <li>dbtest.sessionToken.spec.js</li>: Shows how to get a session token needed for operations that modify the database.
        <li>dbtest.modify.seedings.spec.js</li>: Shows how to create, delete and update seeding logs in the database.
    </ol>
