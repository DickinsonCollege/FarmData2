    Surpressing Standard Name Error (#627)
    
    __Pull Request Description__
    
    Closes #565. Adds a simple simple `@` in front of the cmd command that
    maps the user ID's and names as a preprocessing function. This error
    would appear when users attempted to access a page without being logged
    into the page. The warning no longer appears due to this surpression and
    a comment explaining the `@` placement is now present in the module
    files.

    Encapsulating Button Cases for the CustomTableComponent (#626)
    
    __Pull Request Description__
    
    Closes #599. This PR adds a computed property to the
    `CustomTableComponent.js` to remove the multiple locations in the
    template checking when to make the selection bar appear in the table.
    Because it would be easy to miss these locations when adding new button
    cases, this computed method serves as a general locations for adding
    this button locations without worrying about making changes to the
    template.
    
    Because this doesn't alter functionality, no additional testing was
    added. However, the table's unit test was updated because the Cypress
    tests for the CSV download broke with the reorganization of the project.
    The path is currently fixed. This is fine because the structure of the
    project doesn't change frequently but should we consider putting more
    resources into making it dynamic to not worry about this in the future?
    This is outside the scope of the issue this PR aims to resolve, but I
    could make an issue if it's worthwhile.

    Added the pageLoaded pattern to barnKit and fieldKit (#624)
    
    __Pull Request Description__
    
    The pageLoaded pattern has been applied to the barnKit and fieldKit
    pages. This pattern places a hidden element in the page that has its
    value set to true when all of the API calls in the `created` method have
    completed. This is used in testing to ensure that the page has fully
    loaded before the tests are run.
    
    This is important because when pages are loading information in the
    `created` method, fast running tests were completing and the next test
    was starting before those API requests had completed or even been
    initiated. This was generating flakiness in the test suite. It would run
    fine one time and not the next. Waiting for the page to load introduces
    delays, but removes the flakiness.

    Clarified and fixed CustomTable data-cy attributes for input elements (#623)
    
    __Pull Request Description__
    
    The CustomTableComponent `data-cy` attributes for input elements did not
    uniquely identify the input element. In particular, if two elements had
    the same type of input they would have had the same `data-cy` attribute
    value. They now have the value `ri-columnHeader-input` where the
    `columnHeader` is the header of their column in the table. This matches
    what is done for cells when the table is not in edit mode.

    Backend and Frontend Fixes for Transplanting Report (#615)
    
    __Pull Request Description__
    
    Closes #562. This issue makes some changes to the `updateRow` function
    located in the Transplanting Report HTML file
    [[here](https://github.com/FarmData-2-Dev-Team-2022/FarmData2/blob/fixTransplantingBackend/farmdata2/farmdata2_modules/fd2_barn_kit/transplantingReport/transplantingReport.html)].
    These changes are not accompanied by any Cypress e2e testing as that is
    a separate issue to be addressed in issue #578. As a result, these
    changes have been tested by sight using Hoppscotch.
    
    Additionally, this PR makes a quick fix of the filters for both the
    Seeding Report and Transplanting Report where editing once would
    permanently disable the filters until the page was refreshed because the
    name of the edit cancellation event was changed and the pages were not
    updated accordingly to reflect this change.
    
    This PR also brings up the topic of #585 (and #466) of what should be
    edit-able. I disabled the ability to edit `bed feet` in the
    Transplanting Report because transplanting logs don't have quantity data
    for `bed feet` but also enabled the ability to edit `row/bed` because
    that does exist in the logs' quantity data. However, should users be
    allowed to edit that data? This is beyond the scope of this PR but
    wanted to quickly mention this quick thought that occurred to me whilst
    making this fix.

    Reorganizes the Documentation across the repo. (#614)
    
    __Pull Request Description__
    
    This PR reorganizes the documentation as follows:
    - CONTRIBUTING focuses on making a first contribution.
    - A RESOURCES page is added serves as a pointer to all other
    documentation.
    - READMEs for each type of work (modules, libraries, api, etc.) are kept
    with their code and linked from RESOURCES.
    - A root level `docs` folder is added to hold "big picture" docs that
    are not tied to a specific directory and are linked from RESOURCES.
    
    - This is not quite complete but is largely complete. After this is
    merged it will still be necessary to write a few docs, including:
      - Revise `farmdata2_modules/README.md`
      - Write `farmdata2_modules/fd2_example/README.md`
      - Write `farmdata2_api/README.md`
    
    New issues should be created for each of these when this PR is merged.
    
    Closes #609
    Closes #610
    Closes #572
    
    Changes to the INSTALL.md document were

    Updated fd2-down.bash to remove dev container. (#603)
    
    __Pull Request Description__
    
    Updates fd2-down.bash to remove the dev container when FarmData2 is shut
    down. There was an issue when running in WSL that is addressed by this
    fix. The fix is a little unsatisfactory in that the writeable later in
    the dev container is lost. Thus, any local installs done are lost when
    FarmData2 is taken down. If this presents a challenge for lots of
    developers then this issue should be revisited.
    
    This closes #584.

    Reorganization of the farmdata2 modules (#602)
    
    __Pull Request Description__
    
    This PR reorganizes the code for the FarmData2 modules and api. There is
    now a `farmdata2` directory that contains all of the api and application
    code for FarmData2 in a single location. In that directory there are
    directories for `farmdata2_api` and `farmdata2_modules`.
    
    In the `farmdata2_modules` directory there is a directory for each of
    the modules (e.g. `fd2_barn_kit`, `fd2_example`, etc) and the
    `resources` directory.
    
    In the directory for each module there are the `.info` and `.module`
    files along with any other files necessary to create the Drupal module.
    There is then a directory for each sub-tab that appears in the farmOS
    UI. For example, in the `fd2_example` folder there are folders for
    `Info`, `Vars`, `Maps`, `API`, `Cache` and `UI`.
    
    In each of the sub-tab folders is the `.html` file that contains the
    code for the sub-tab along with a collection of `.spec.js` files that
    hold the e2e tests for the sub-tab.
    
    This organization should make it easier to create new sub-tabs and to
    organize the tests for each sub-tab.
    
    The testing and documentation scripts were moved up to the `farmdata2`
    directory so that they can now be used both with the modules and the
    api.

    Updating Export Button Functionality (#591)
    
    * CustomTableComponent Changes
    1. Updated the exportCSV() function to only print rows whose IDs can be found in the indexesToAction array.
    2. Made sure the button is disabled when nothing is selected just like the delete button and custom buttons.
    
    * CustomTableComponent Changes
    1. Changed the way the csv file object was created. Apparently using the URI encoder limits the amount of data that can be downloaded into the csv. Using a blob object seems to solve this issue.
    2. Made it so that if the delete or custom buttons are not present, the select a row feature still appears if the dev allows for csv buttons. This did not exist before, probably an oversight due to export functionality being considered after the fact.
    CustomTable Unit Test Changes
    1. Updated the unit test to verify that the export button is unclickable when no rows are selected. Made sure downloading one row is assured. Made sure downloading multiple rows is assured.
    
    * Removed 'Only' from the CustomTable Unit Test
    
    * Removed Double //
    
    * CustomTable Changes
    1. Added the ' -' back to replacing new lines among other things

    Add Custom FarmData2 API container (#596)
    
    Adds a container for an express API. This api will allow FarmData2 to have custom API endpoints that gather data directly from the farmOS database rather than using the farmOS API. This can improve performance because the farmOS data model is general and many FarmData2 views require joins across farmOS tables.

    Refactoring CustomTableComponent (and other updates) (#570)
    
    * Added Two New Files for the Updated CustomTableComponent
    1. These files will be updated with the request changed in the issue
    2. This initial commit is to make sure the remote is working correctly
    
    * Loaded Test Component into UI Page
    1. Had to add a script path to the example tab because the new test component wasn't loading in otherwise
    2. Messing around with making things appear with the new structure of the CustomTableComponent
    3. Modifying the template to iterate through the array of objects correctly (in progress)
    4. Seriously need to look into updating some of the computed methods that deal with visibility since visibility has been updated
    
    * Continued Work on Headers and Input Types
    1. Removed number box input type and replaced it with the RegexInputComponent. Its implementation is unfininshed since it still needs to check for valid inputs and make sure that the save button is disabled when an invalid input it inputted. However, these changes will come after the other abstractions are completed.
    2. The buttons have been abstracted. I haven't deleted all the code for the predefined buttons since I'm using them as a template but the new general button isn't working as intended. It's not rendering in the table when the conditions for it to be rendered are being met.
    
    * Added the Boolean Input Type
    1. Added the Boolean type to the CustomTableComponent. This is a checkbox that, when clicked, that entire row has been selected to be passed for some function (whatever that may be).
    2. Just like the button, the checkboxes don't want to render into the table. Hopefully these two bugs will be fixed in the next commit
    
    * Rendering Incorrectly During Edits
    1. The checkboxes and buttons are now rendering.
    However, whatever is being passed into the table row data (say boolean/button) to indicate that we want a column of checkboxes/unique button is actually being filled into the table data. However, the actual checkbox/button is visible when you want to edit that row. It's as if somehow the states are reversed but we don't want to reverse them back (i.e button/checkbox is rendered but when row is edited they revert to text button/checkbock). We want them to always be rendered as the proper element and not text regardless of whether that row is being edited or not
    
    * Rendering Issue Persists, Continuing on with other Features
    1. The rendering issue has been partially solved by removing the editing row index inside the Vue conditional. However, for the time being, this means that the element being rendered in (e.g. checkbox/button) are manipulate-able whilest editing rows. This will have to be patched out later (or a better implementation should be explored).
    2. Implemented a function for checking all the checkboxes in a column. Currently it changes the Vue data for that row, but it's currently a little buggy and the checkboxes themselves are not checked even though the row itself is checked inside the row data.
    
    * Solved Rendering Problem, Select All & Select Continue to Have Problems
    1. The rendering issue has been solved, the rows data doesn't populate the div anymore in the table for checkboxes/buttons specifically. If additional functionality is added to the table then those also have to be added to the conditional.
    2. Disabled ALL checkboxes/buttons during edits. This choice should be discussed.
    3. Select All works but still continues to make no changes to the actual visual tick in the box which is an indication to the user that the box is actually checked
    4. Select function declared but currently unoperational
    
    * Modified Boolean Type
    1. Removed the selectAll method from this input type since you shouldn't be able to check multiple boxes when only one checkbox can be checked at a time when being edited. This keeps functionality consistent.
    2. Used a more clever trick for the select function which just grabs the column index as well to change the checkbox's boolean value which gets rid of the for loop entirely.
    3. Removed the header box for the boolean input type, it's just a regular text header now.
    
    * Completed Button Additions
    1. Custom Buttons now emit an event for the page to handle
    2. Added a leftmost column that dictates which rows will be affected by the custom button's event
    3. Added a select all feature which allows you to select all the rows
    4. The leftmost column is disabled during edit and so are the custom buttons
    5. None of these changes apply to the export button.
    The new thing on the agenda is the RegExp implementation, after that the refactored CustomTable should be done
    
    * Updated Leftmost Column & Button Changes
    1. Disregard changes to the old CustomTableComponent file. I use it as a testing ground for understanding how the table works and thus making the improved version better.
    2. The leftmost column needs a bit of work due to some inconsistencies between select all and individual selects of the buttons.
    3. The buttons are now using their own emits to grab their things from the child component to the parent page.
    4. RegexInputComponent is still not updating and still has the same issues.
    
    * Updated Checkboxes For Buttons & Cancel Button Moved
    1. Fixed a bug where selecting all and then unchecking one of the rows caused the row to effecively 'disappear' and didn't allow for any action on it anymore.
    2. Updated the clone method in the UI page to be more secure: uses IDs for rows now and shows a case of updating the IDs for a cloned row because otherwise buttons share the same IDs and checking/unchecking one does the same for the other.
    3. Moved the cancel button down to the edit button's space and it only appears when you're editing that one row. It's a bit unpleasing UI wise, but it's not that intrusive.
    
    * RegexInputComponent Integration into Refactored CustomTableComponent
    1. The RegexInComponent finally works with the refactored CustomTableComponent.
    However, the editing is done in a rather indirect way. Unlike the other types of editing types inside the table, the RegexInputComponent has to use it's @input-changed and pass it to another function to make the necessary changes.
    Additionally, a change had to be made to the RegexInputComponent.
    The v-model had to be removed as well.
    
    * Changes to RegexInputComponent Integration
    1. The default value prop is now being provided with the editedRowData.data[i] to be consistent with the rest of the input types in the table.
    2. Made some changes to the setMatchVal (previous logic was pretty roundabout)
    3. RegexInputComponent had it match emit only on change restored and moved the emitting of the value until after that check to give the table time to update its own isMatch value before adding the value into the editedRowData.data[i]. This fixes a bug where the isMatch value wasn't being updated in time and thus invalid values were being passed into the regex-input which broke it even when the value inside was altered to a valid one.
    
    * Updated Code According to Feedback in Code Review
    1. UI PAGE CHANGES
    Removed the match value from the Regex input type, was leftover from initial design which was changed.
    Renamed 'box' for button box colors to 'buttonClass' to be more inline with what it's actually attached to in the component. Additionally the 'header' was renamed to 'hoverTip' to be more self explanatory.
    2. CUSTOMTABLECOMPONENT CHANGES
    Changes the data-cy values for the buttons to be inline with the data-cy values of the pre-existing buttons. Got rid of any instance of 'btn' and just used 'button' instead.
    Dropped the '-event' from the button emit and it just now emits the name of the event for the parent page to catch. No more '@eventName-event' just '@event' in the parent page now.
    Couldn't find anything about the payload being copied for the emit so in the meantime the payload is being copies to make sure an empty payload isn't being sent.
    Got rid of a potentially unobservable bug of multiple select all boxes being overlapped because of an unnecessary v-for when creating the button in the header.
    Cleaned the columns from any dated code (boolean types used to be separate and checking for cases that weren't necessary anymore)
    Updated data-cy for all the row data (e.g row0-date).
    Moved v-if for the table row data to the top for each HTML element
    Removed select function for boolean types. Unnecessary.
    UpdateSelectAll function has been rewritten. NOTE: should receive another lookover for soundness.
    Linger CustomTableComponent computed methods removed.
    Deep watch commented out in the meantime.
    3. REGEXINPUTCOMPONENT Changes
    Simply added a comment explaining why the match value is initially null
    
    * More Code Review Changes
    1. CUSTOMTABLECOMPONENT CHANGES
    Simplified the logic for selectAll function
    Removed all debugging code (i.e console.logs)
    
    * Radical Changes
    1. DELETED
    Deleted the old CustomTableComponent
    Deleted the old CustomTableComponents unit test
    Deleted a script from the example.info file for the refactored CustomTableComponent
    2. RENAMED
    Renamed the newCustomTableComponent to CustomTableComponent
    Same as above for the unit test
    3. PROBLEMS
    All sub-tabs using the CustomTableComponent are broken, including the UI page.
    Unit test for the CustomTableComponent doesn't want to start.
    
    * Removed Lingering Mentions of the NewCustomTableComponent
    1. UI PAGE
    Removed any lingering method names that had the 'new' label to differentiate them from the old CustomTable methods.
    2. CUSTOMTABLECOMPONENT.js
    Removed any lingering mentions of the 'NewCustomTableComponent' from the file.
    
    * Fixed Bug where CustomTable Wasn't Initialized Properly
    1. CONFIG INFO
    Moved the RegexInputComponent's initialization higher to fix a bug where it was being initialized after the CustomTable was trying to use
    2. CustomTableComponent.js
    Added the export at the top for the RegexInputComponent
    
    * CustomTableComponent Changes
    1. Fixed a bug where the leftmost column was still actionable when editing a row
    2. Fixed a bug where the delete button was still enabled while editing. This allowed for an edited row to be deleted during editing which kept the table stuck in an editing state
    3. CONCERN: The CustomTable needs to be fed a customButton array. Even if its empty, it needs to be feed one or it runs into rendering errors. This should be discussed.
    CustomTableComponent Cypress Changes
    1. All tests have been updated to reflect the refactoring of the CustomTable
    2. The CSV context no longer works due to a OS process issue
    3. Save button test isn't working properly
    RegexInputComponent Changes
    1. Some small changes.
    RegexInputComponent Cypress Changes
    1. Made some small changes to account for the isMatch being null initially
    UI Changes
    1. Some small UI changes were made to test the CustomTable visually.
    
    * Changes to UI Page
    1. Removed (hopefully) remaining vestiges of the 'new' variable names from the UI page. The last remaining instances of it had not been removed from the show/hide column button.
    Changes to UI End-to-End Test
    1. Updated CustomTable tests.
    Changes to CustomTableComponent
    1. Updated the finishEditRow() function to correctly update the JSONObject returned to the page. For whatever reason, it didn't actually affect editing in any visible capacity but this should fix any unforeseeable bugs (hopefully).
    2. Gave the CustomButtons prop a default value of empty array to avoid problems when devs do not give a CustomButton prop to their table which caused rendering issues due to a null assignment
    Changes to CustomTable Unit Test
    1. Thanks to the fix of the finishEditRow(), the save tests are now working as expected.
    2. CSV context suite has been restored but only works within the vnc (fd2dev container).
    
    * Changes in Seeding Report
    1. Reconfigured the table to remove the input types, headers, and visible columns which were all combined into the new tableColumns data.
    2. There's a bug where the user, crop, and area maps aren't being properly loading in for editing.
    3. The table can display the correct headers according to the type of seeding.
    4. Delete and edit functionality need to be updated.
    Changes in Transplanting Report
    1. Reconfigured the table to remove input types, headers, and visible columns which were all combined into the new tableColumns data.
    2. There's a bug where the user, crop, and area maps aren't being properly loaded in while editing
    3. The table needs to have its edit and delete fuctionalities updated.
    Changes in UI Page
    1. Simple changed a small inconsistency in the columns data.
    
    * Seeding Report Changes
    1. Updated the deleting function so that it can support multiple deletes.
    2. Removed debugging code and reminants of old table data.
    Transplanting Report Changes
    1. Updated the deleting function so that it can support multiple deletes.
    CustomTable Changes:
    1. Fixed a bug where regex inputs weren't returning anything in the json object so updating the backend wasn't happening.
    
    * Added Documentation
    Transplanting Report Changes
    1. Removed debugging code
    
    * Changes to Seeding Report
    1. Added a promise check for the deletion of logs.
    Changes to Transplanting Report
    1. Added a promise check for the deletion of logs.
    Changes to UI Page
    1. Added a promise check for the deletion of rows
    Changes to CustomTableComponent
    1. Added a deep watch that's supposed to keep an eye on the columns prop and update it on the table end. It's currently not functioning correctly.
    
    * Seeding Report Changes
    1. Returning the columns prop in the CustomTable through a computed propety now. The generation of the user, area, and crop name arrays have also been separated into their own properties in anticiaption of another issue.
    2. Removed old code
    CustomTableComponent Changes
    1. Removed watcher.
    2. Left updatedColumns piece in anticipation that it might be used again
    
    * CustomTable Changes
    1. Commented out updatedColumns piece
    
    * Seeding Report Changes
    1. Realized that I didn't save the file and thus my removal of old code wasn't present in the last commit.
    Transplanting Report Changes
    1. Made sure it was using the same computed property structure as the Seeding Report page.

    Repairing Updating Rows from within the Seeding Report (#551)
    
    * Everything updates except for Crop, Area, and Date. These need to be updated.
    1. Cypress tests need to be added to more rigorously test this change
    
    * Updated Cypress Test to Be More Rigorous
    1. There's a bug where changing area and quantity is causing a 422 status code.
    2. The Cypress test seems to not be updating the values. This has to seriosuly be investigated.
    
    * Updated Seeding Report Page
    1. Fixed a bug where updating the quantity and the area at the same time would result in a 422 status code from the server.
    2. FIxed a bug where editing date, crop, area, comments, or user alongside any of the quantities would not update the log on the frontend with the appropriate information.
    3. Added the IDToAreaMap in order to fix an issue where area would be empty inside the report page when updating it alongside other quantities.
    4. Still need to update/add Cypress test(s) to test these changes
    
    * Removed the Addition of the IDToAreaMap Solution
    1. Made sure that the log inside of the report is accurate to the backend
    
    * Adding More Rigorous Cypress Tests for the Editing Functionality
    1. Unfinished currently because we have to create a direct seeding log and an asset for testing purposes and the asset is producing an error.
    
    * Completed the Cypress Testing for Updating Logs

    Addition of a Transplanting Report (#542)
    
    * Transplanting Report Added to Barn Kit Module
    1. Modified BarnKit module to include a new sub-tab for the Transplanting Report.
    2. Added the Transplanting Report to the Barn Kit module as a sub-tab.
    3. Added its test file (currently empty).
    
    * Removed Unnecessary Code from the Transplanting Report
    1. Still need to update the code for editing to work correct
    2. Still need to update the code for deleting to work correct
    3. Touch-ups of the code and a discussion of original seeding dates needs to be had
    
    * Transplanting Report Almost Complete
    1. The edit and the delete methods need to be looked at closely
    2. Copy and pasted the Seeding Report's test for the Transplanting Report for now
    
    * Added Cypress Testing for the Transplanting Report
    1. Adjusted most of the Cypress tests for the Transplanting Report. Editing and deleting need to be analyzed.
    2. There's a bug where h.data is null for the cropList that needs to be explored.
    
    * Updated Config Tests
    1. The Config tests now properly work on the page. Some additional tests still need to be added for summary tables though.
    2. Edit/Delete still need to be fixed
    
    * Committed for Reviewing Purposes
    1. The edit/delete Cypress test are still throwing the 406 error, so I'm committing my changes so that others can see what I'm seeing on my screen
    
    * Added Labor Config Test for Summary Table
    1. The labor configuration tests for the summary table calculations has been added.
    2. The edit/delete still need to be looked at closely
    
    * Edit/Delete Function but Exhibit Similar Behavior to Seeding Report
    1. The edit/delete functionality now works but exhibits the same behavior as the Seeding Report. Changing things for crop and area doesn't actually change anything in the backend and test produce a 500 error code for this but still pass
    
    * Updated Inconsistencies and Corrected Some Issues
    1. The hours method accurately calculates the total number of hours now. The Cypress test associated with this change have also been updated.
    2. Updated some lingering code copied over from the Seeding Report.
    3. Checked out the db.sample.tar.bz2 file from main to hopefully avoid any difference when merging to upstream.

    2. Fixed some code to allow for a conditional to take care of cases where seeding is 0.
    3. Rebuilt the database.
    4. Fixed the Seeding Report Cypress tests due to the changes in the database.

    Fixed Static CSV File Names (#529)
    
    * Added a Prop to Disable CSV Button and Control Its File Name
    1. Added a new prop in the CustomTableComponent which is a blank string by default. A v-if inside of the button does not render the CSV button if that string is empty.
    2. The prop allows devs to choose the name of their CSV files.
    3. Added this functionality to the Seeding Report's customTableComponent.
    4. Added a small test to verify that the button does not exist.
    
    * Added Requested Changed
    1. Added the prop to the UI page's CustomTableComponent so that the button appears.
    2. Added documentation for the new prop within the CustomTableComponent's javascript file.
    3. Regenerated the documentation inside of doc.

    Implementing Standard Error Handling for API Request Failures (#524)
    
    * Added API Error Handling in UI Page
    1. Fixed a small typo in the Seeding Input form
    2. Added an example of error handling inside of the UI page
    3. Added a test in the UI's e2e to cover this new example
    
    * Updated UI Page & Its Testing Page
    1. Added conditional statements to the catch(err) to handle the three types of possible errors per Axios documentation.
    2. Left documentation from that page so that the different conditionals explain what type of errors they are catching.
    3.Updated the UI testing page to include three tests for each type of error the API standard error handler is supposed to catch
    
    * Updated the Seeding Input Page & Cypress e2e Test
    1. Added the error handling to the API calls inside of the Seeding Input Page.
    2. Added the alert banner to display inside of the Seeding Input page when an API call fails.
    3. Added Cypress tests into the Seeding Inputs e2e test file to cover API fail cases.
    4. Changes some small things in the UI page with an array being shared between two tests. (They still do, but it now clears itself when the other's button is clicked)
    5. Made some small changes to the UI Cypress e2e page.
    
    * Updated the Seeding Report Page and Cypress e2e Test
    1. Added the API failure banner to the Seeding Report and all the catch errors for API request in the page.
    2. Added API failure tests to Cypress e2e test file for the Seeding Report
    3. Made some small changes to the Seeding Input e2e test file.
    
    * Fixed Indentation and Removed Unnecessary Documentation
    
    * Updated the Seeding Input & Report Pages and Test for Auto Scroll
    1. Added a scroll to feature that scrolls to the top of the page for the error banner in both the Seeding Input and Seeding Report.
    2. Added tests for this feature into both e2e Cypress tests
    
    * Simplied Catch Statement in All API Calls
    1. Removed the conditionals to catch different types of errors.
    
    * Removed Some more Redundant Code
    1. Removed the intricate conditonals in the Seeding Input for a more simple approach
    
    * Changed All the scrollTo's to scrollBy's
    
    * Changed the Auto Scroll to be More in Line with Seeding Input PR
    1. Changed the auto scroll for the error banner to be in-line with the auto scroll for the success and cancel banners inside of the Seeding Input
    2. Moved the error banner inside of the same div as the other banners inside of the Seeding Input.
    3. Used the same div format inside of the Seeding Report so that things remain consistent throughout different pages.
    4. Made some accomodations to the tests for these recent changes.

    Seeding Input: Auto Scrolls to Banners at the Top of Page (#525)
    
    * Seeding Input Scrolls Up to See Banners
    1. Added some JavaScript to scroll to the banners at the top of the report so that they're visible to the user after a confirm/cancel.
    
    * Updated Seeding Input e2e Test
    1. Disabled Cypress's auto scroll behavior in the two tests for the confirm/cancel button. Nothing else in thos individual tests wer changed since the changes in the page should already test whether those banners are visible or not.
    2. Added a scrollIntoView function to labor to help the those two tests where the auto scroll was disabled since auto scroll is disabled for those two
    
    * Updated Cypress Testing
    1. Added a more rigorus test for the scroll up feature.
    2. Removed the auto scroll disable and the scroll being used on labor to scroll down
    3. There's a bug where the tests ONLY work if the data-cy's being grabbed are reversed. So if the cancel button is clicked the cancel banner is visible but the test only works if you cy.get(success banner) and vice-versa for the confirm button
    
    * Changed Auto Scroll Behavior and Modified Tests
    1. Changed the auto scroll behavior from scrollIntoView to scrollTo with specific coordinates for the location of the cancel/submitted banner. Unfortunatelythe FarmData2 banner gets in the way, so we have to scroll to a specific position in order to see the banner.
    2. Updated the tests in the Cypress to reflect these changes. They passed under .only and when the entire file of tests was run
    
    * Updated scrollTo To Be Dynamic and not Static
    1. Changed the static pixel value to grab the lower bounds of the alert banner and then subtract the lower bounds of the header that obscures it.
    2. Moved the alert banner to be below the Seeding Input Log header.
    
    * Changed the scrollTo to scrollBy.
    1. Changed the scroll function that's being used.
    2. Removed the 'onlys' that were still in the Seeding Input test.
    3. Adjusted the tests to reflect these changes
    
    * Removed Console Log from Seeding Input

    CustomTableComponent: Adding Export Functionality (#517)
    
    * Adding Export Functionality to CustomTableComp
    1. Added a button labeled 'Export' at the top of the table that, when clicked, will export the current table as a csv file for the user
    2. Added a new method inside of the CustomTableComp called 'exportCSV' which will be in charge of generated and exporting the CSV file.
    3. Currently the aforementioned method can export a CSV file containing the headers. Next is working on the difficult part of including data from entire rows.
    
    * CSV function now has row data
    1. Row data now appears under the appropriate header inside the of the CSV file export.
    2. Unfortunately comments break the structure of the CSV file. More time is needed to determine whether or not this can be fixed or if it would be more efficient to just ignore comments altogether in the export data.
    
    * CVS Export Now Cleans Strings
    1. Fixed an issue in the last commit where comments were breaking the structure of the CSV. Turns out the backend is adding HTML elements to the comments field inside of the Seeding Input to make sure the table grows and displays the whole contents of the comment column. In order to combat this, the exportCSV method checks to see if an element is a string and then removed all <p>, </p>, <br /> and new lines from the comments so the CSV structure isn't compromised.
    2. The code inside of the component still needs to be cleaned and tested must be done to assure inside the CustomTableComponent's Cypress file.
    
    * Cleaned the CustomTableComponent
    1. Cleaned the identation and spacing for the CustomTableComponent. Added a couple of comments to the exportCSV method to explain certain aspects of the code.
    2. Started adding tests to the CustomTableComponent's Cypress file.
    
    * Added Cypress Testing for CSV Function
    1. Added Cypress tests for the CSV function.
    2. Made sure that the downloads folder inside of the Cypress folder clears all of its contents after the last test, that way the folder isn't holding unnecessary files.
    3. Fixed some weird things with the template (span and div were swapped).
    
    * Changed the cy.exec so the Downloads folder is deleted entirely
    1. Previously only deleted contents of the folder, now it deleted the contents and the folder itself

    Refactoring Pre-existing Seeding Report e2e Test (#514)
    
    * Cypress test changes for editing/deleting buttons
    Fixing the test, but it currently is not accepting a valid column and row
    
    * Additions to Seeding Report and Refactor Cypress Tests
    Seeding Report had some data-cy tags added to the summary tables to easily access that data for testing purposes. All Cypress tests that were malfunctioning due to CustomTable changes are now working. All Cypress e2e tests now work. Some additional ones need to be added to account for API calls.
    
    * Cypress Tests: Testing API and Filter Selection
    Added tests to make sure that the filter dropdowns are being populated by the API calls to the crop map and area map.
    Added tests to make sure selections in one filter dropdown impact the options in the other filter dropdowns.
    Added coverge for visible columns when the edit button makes the save and cancel headers visible.
    
    * Refactored Cypress Test File Structure
    Removed a good amount of the logins from the beforeEach calls made inside of contexts and allowed that to always occur in the describe before each test. This seems to have helped significantly reduce the amount of times a potential 403 error might occur at the cost of increased test time since the beforeEach in the describe runs for each test.
    Additionally, some of the API calls are currently incomplete because I do not know where exactly to make those API calls to.
    
    * Fixed API Issue
    The first test was causing the rest of a context to fail since it was reloading the page.
    Removed commented code.
    Made sure everything was properly indented and spaced.
    
    * Removed some redundant tests
    1. Removed a repeated tests that tested filter behavior
    
    * Made Requested Changes to the Seeding Report e2e Test
    1. Added two more data-cys to the Seeding Report html page in order to verify if the text denoting no longs are there for that seeding type is present or not
    2. Removed a context and combined some of its contents to another context because they overlap.
    3. Changed the edit/deleting tests at the end of the e2e file.
    4. (Hopefully) Fixed all spacing and indentation concerns

    * Added some new Cypress e2e tests for the new RegexInputComp in the UI sub-tab
    
    * Changed the method in the UI page so that when users click a button for the regex the input box is just set 0 so they have to type something in there to test it out. This is because I couldn't get the page to focus on the element in the page so this is the work around. Made the appropriate adjustments in the Cypress test to accomodate this change too
    
    * Updated the manner by which the regular expression was being updated by pressing the buttons. Now a map is used where keys are utilized to access the values to pass to the regular expression Vue data which is binded to the regexcomp in the html.
    
    * The positive decimals and ints were swapped around. I correct this error so this code is correct.
    
    * refactored disabled button and methods
    
    * fixed disabled cypress tests
    
    * fixed dropdown test

    * Changed the way that hours are computed in the Seeding Report to be in the format 'e.g 2 workers for 1 hour = 2 hours'

    Seeding Report Edits (#474)
    
    * Switched the 'Workers' and 'Hours' columns to more clearly present that hours are totaled together and not hours worked per worker. Fixed some inconsistencies with some headers being capitalized and others not
    
    * Corrected some table headers to be more concise. IN the seeding's column, removed the word 'seeding' for conciseness.
    
    * The 'Hours' column now consistenly displays hours up to the second decimal place. Fixed a bug where summary pages where not accurately displaying that no logs with the appropriate parameters existed after filtering through the table
    
    * Rearranged the headers for direct seeding. Made sure that the data attached has their orders corrected as well. Summary page for direct seeding has the data it as fetching updated to grab the correct values

    add quotation marks to html attribute values (#455)
    
    These quotation marks are not needed for correctness,
    but it is better to include them for consistency and
    for other reasons.
    See e.g.
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6495310/do-you-quote-html5-attributes
    It would be even better would to keep a consistent style with either
    all single quotes or all double quotes,
    but in this commit we are just adding quotation marks where
    they are missing altogether.

    Removed apt update from Cypress Dockerfile (#280)
    
    As apt packages were modified by others this began generating errors.
    Becasue this is a dev only container we'll leave everything fixed

    Request Tray Seeding Report - Epic (#157)
    
    * Provided a dropdown list of crops,in alphabetical order, from the farmOS API to choose from.
    
    * Added start date and end date inputs to the tray seeding report tab, and set the default end date to the current day.

    * Added comments to traySeedingReport.html for better readability
    
    * Added a traySeedingLogRequest method that will make an API request to get seeding logs within the dates specified in the start and end date inputs. Also began to fill in table with appropriate variables from the request.
    
    * Added a traySeedingLogRequest method that sends an API request for tray seeding logs between the specified start and end dates. The dates of each log are added to the table, but all of the other details are currently blank.
    
    * Added <br> to move the generate report button to a new different line than the start and end date inputs.
    
    * Added generate report button and a mock report table

    * Altered the processing of the API Request response so that the data is saved as-is and then the specific information needed to display in the report is sorted out within the table.
    
    * Simplified the traySeedingLogRequest method.
    
    * Started filling rows, still need a way to extract the right data

    * Added Delete button to table. If Delete is pressed then the row is deleted
    
    * when there is no data the table does not appear instead there is a message: There is no mathcing records
    
    * The report is hidden until the Generate Report button is clicked for the first time
    
    * cannot set the start date of the harvest report ot be after the end data and vice vera. They can be set to the same data though
    
    * Adds the yield of the data displayed in the table. Outputs it underneath the table
    
    * added A05 subtab
    
    * connected the field pull down menu to the farm database

    * the table has elements that only have the field that was selected
    
    * can now use the start and end dates to specify which logs show up in the table
    
    * the dropdown slection on the crop will now help spefify which logs are added to the table
    
    * added html file called transplanting and it has a heading: Transplanting Report
    
    * added subtab called transplanting that connects to the transplanting.html file
    
    * Intialized Vue variable and added a div section: Transplanting report
    
    * table created for data insertion
    
    * took out spike subtabs in FD2 Example tab
    
    * added input for start date. This input changes the startDate varaible in Vue.js to the inputed date.
    
    * A date input was added for the user to add an End date for their desired range. The input is saved into the endDate variable in Vue.js. A max for the start date and a min for the end date was added. These were linked to each other.
    
    * added a field variable to store all fields and a drop down list of field for selection
    
    * Now when the generate button is hit the instnace that appear in Vue.js from the data are only after the start date that was inputed
    
    In order for this to be created, a Generate Report button, a logs variable in Vue.js, and a saveLogs method was created. When the Generate report button is cicked the saveLogs method is started. In the saved logs method a variable called link is created. This variable is set to the standard link for all transplanting log. Then if startDate is not empty then the link variable is added to inorder to create a link that will get all transplanting logs created after that start date. Then that link is used in the axios call. In order to do this, the methodstimestampToYMD and YMDToTimestamp were created. This methods change YMD time to timestamp time and vice versa.
    
    * the variable endDate now effects what logs show up in the Vue.js logs.
    
    In the saveLogs method, if the endDate variable is not empty. The link varibale is added to, so that the link will only call transplanting logs that happened before that date.
    
    * Added crop name filtering to the table
    
    * added varaibles rowfeet and rowbed to each log. These variables find the row feet and row/bed data from each log.
    
    * Added bed feet to the transplanting table.
    
    In order to do this, a calculate bed feet method was required. This took in the row feet and rowbed data. It used the methods getRowFeet and getRowBed to seperate the number from the rest of the data. It then divided row feet by rowbed to get bed feet
    
    * Table displays rows/bed now
    
    * Added user that created the report to the table
    
    * Deleted test message from transplanting page
    
    * this story added the comment to the table.
    
    it did this by accessing the notes in the logs and printing the information in the value key of the notes array
    
    * reversed the rowPerBed and rowFeet in the table. There were in the wrong place
