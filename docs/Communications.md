# Communications in FarmData2 #

FarmData2 uses three primary communications channels.  Each channel serves a slightly different purpose.  When communicating with the community try to pick the most appropriate channel.  

  - [The FarmData2 community on Zulip][zulipCommunity]
    - The Zulip community is the place where you can introduce yourself to the FarmData2 community, ask and answer questions about using FarmData2, developing FarmData2, the installation process, how to get started or technology. If you have a tentative idea for a new feature or are unsure if what you are seeing is a bug, the Zulip streams are a good place to have an initial conversation before creating a ticket in the Issue Tracker (below).  If you are unsure who to ask or how to ask, start by reaching out on Zulip. The project maintainers monitor the Zulip streams and will respond to questions there.

  - [Issue Tracker][issueTracker]
    - If you want to report a bug, want to request a new feature, have an idea about how to address an existing issue, or have started working on an issue and have questions, then the Issue Tracker is the channel to use. If you have thoughts or questions about an issue with an existing ticket, then adding comments to that ticket is the appropriate way to communicate. If you need to report a bug for which there is no ticket or you want to request a new feature, then creating a new ticket is the appropriate approach. There are links to additional information on reporting new bugs or requesting new features on the [RESOURCES](../RESOURCES.md) page. 

  - [Pull Requests][pullRequests]
    - If you have specific code or documentation changes that you want to contribute or partially coded bug fixes or implementations that you want to discuss, then a pull request is the appropriate channel. For contributions that you believe are complete, make a normal pull request.  A project maintainer will review your request and will communicate with you through comments on the pull request if revisions are needed.  If your changes are not complete but you have questions or would like input from a project maintainer then make a *draft pull request*.  Explain the purpose of your pull request in the body and include a link to the ticket for the issue you are addressing (e.g. Closes #123). Then add a comment to the pull request asking the specific question about your code or documentation.
