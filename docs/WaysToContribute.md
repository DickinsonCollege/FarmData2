# Ways to Contribute to FarmData2

## Fixing Issues and Adding Features

The most common way to contribute to FarmData2 is through fixing issues or adding new features.  A complete guide to making these types of contributions is provided in the [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) document.

## Bug Reporting ##

If you are a user of FarmData2 and discover something that doesn't seem to be working correctly, you can:

  1. Reach out to the community on the [Zulip Developer Stream](https://farmdata2.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/271292-developers) to discuss what you have found and how to proceed.
  2. Search the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/DickinsonCollege/FarmData2/issues) to see if the bug has been reported already.
     - If it has, add a comment to the ticket to let us know you have confirmed the bug or to add any additional information you think will be useful.
     - If it has not, open a new ticket describing the bug.  Your ticket should include:
       - A description of the bug.
       - A detailed set of steps that another developer can use to observe the bug.
       - What you observe that indicates that the bug occurred. Annotated screen shots can be particularly helpful here. 
       - What you expect the behavior or output to be if the bug is fixed.
       - If relevant, information about the platform on which you are running FarmData2 and the browser(s) you have used to verify your bug.

## Feature Requests ##

If you are a user of FarmData2 and have a new feature you would like to see, you can:

  - Reach out to the FarmData2 community on the [Zulip Developer Stream](https://farmdata2.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/271292-developers) to discuss the feature you'd like to see and how to proceed.
  - Search the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/DickinsonCollege/FarmData2/issues) to see if the feature, or something close, has already been suggested by someone.
    - If it has, add a comment to the ticket lending support and possibly refining or giving your perspective on the idea.
    - If it has not, open a new ticket and give a description of the new feature you would like to see.

## Bug Gardening ##

The project [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/DickinsonCollege/FarmData2/issues) contains tickets describing known issues (bugs, feature requests, etc.) with the project.  The tickets for known bugs are tagged with the label "bug."  The ticket for each reported bug should have a detailed description of how the bug can be observed, what the expected output is, and what the observed output is. 

Bug Gardening includes activities such as:

  - Confirming that bug does (or does not) exist in the current version.
  - Verifying or improving the steps for observing a bug.
  - Narrowing down examples that are used to illustrate the bug.
  - Providing additional information about the bug (e.g. platforms on which it is or is not seen).

To participate in Bug Gardening, visit the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/DickinsonCollege/FarmData2/issues) and find a ticket about something of interest to verify, enhance, or clarify.  Try it out in your running version of FarmData2 and add a comment to the ticket with what you find.

If you find typos, unclear or missing steps, poorly worded explanations, or have any other suggestions for how the documentation could be improved, use the process described in the [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) document to submit your suggested changes as a pull request.
