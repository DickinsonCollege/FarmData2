The project [Issue Tracker] contains tickets describing known issues with the project.  The tickets for known issues are tagged with the label "bug".  Each reported bug is to have a detailed description of how the bug can be observed. Gardening includes activities such as:

  * Verifying or clarifying that these descriptions.

  * Enhance the report by providing additional information about the bug (e.g. platforms on which is is or is not seen).

  * Confirming that bug does (or does not) exist in the current version.

To participate by Gardening follow the [Install Directions] to get FarmData2 up and running. Then visit the [Issue Tracker] and find something of interest to verify, enhance or clarify.  Add a comment to the ticket with what you find.

#### Documentation or Code Contributions ####

If you are interested in contributing documentation or code changes, the project generally uses the [GitHub Flow](https://githubflow.github.io/) branching workflow and accepts contributions via Pull Requests.

The basic steps for working with GitHub Flow is as follows:

  * Go to the [FarmData2 Repository] (the _upstream_)
  * Fork the _upstream_ repository to your GitHub (the _origin_).
  * Clone the _origin_ repository to your local machine.
  * Set the  _upstream_ remote for your local repository to point to the _upstream_ repository.
  * Create a _feature branch_ from the _main_ branch your local machine.
  * Make the edits to the documentation or the code in your _feature branch_.
  * Commit your edits.
  * Push your _feature branch_ to the _origin_.
  * Make a Pull Request for your _feature branch_ to the _upstream_.
