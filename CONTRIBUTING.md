#### Documentation or Code Contributions ####

If you are interested in contributing documentation or code changes, the project generally uses the [GitHub Flow](https://githubflow.github.io/) branching workflow and accepts contributions via Pull Requests.

The basic steps for working with GitHub Flow is as follows:

  * Go to the [FarmData2 Repository] (the _upstream_)
  * Fork the _upstream_ repository to your GitHub (the _origin_).
  * Clone the _origin_ repository to your local machine.
  * Set the  _upstream_ remote for your local repository to point to the _upstream_ repository.
  * Create a _feature branch_ from the _main_ branch your local machine.
  * Make the edits to the documentation or the code in your _feature branch_.
  * Commit your edits.
    * If the contribution reflects the work of multiple people, ensure that
    everyone receives attribution by [Creating a commit with multiple authors].
  * Pull the most recent _upstream_ version of the _main branch_.
  * Merge the update _main branch_ into your _feature branch_.
  * Push your _feature branch_ to the _origin_.
  * Make a Pull Request for your _feature branch_ to the _upstream_.
