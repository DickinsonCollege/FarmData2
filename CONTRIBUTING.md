The project [Issue Tracker] contains tickets describing known issues with the project.  The tickets for known issues are tagged with the label "bug".  Each reported bug will have a detailed description of how the bug can be observed. Gardening includes activities such as:

  * Verifying or clarifying these descriptions.

  * Enhance the report by providing additional information about the bug (e.g. platforms on which is is or is not seen).

  * Confirming that bug does (or does not) exist in the current version.

To participate by Gardening follow the [Install Directions] to get FarmData2 up and running. Then visit the [Issue Tracker] and find something of interest to verify, enhance or clarify.  Add a comment to the ticket with what you find.

  * Search the [Issue Tracker] to see if the feature, or something close, has already been suggested by someone.

    * If it has, add a comment lending support and possibly refining or giving your perspective on the idea.

    * If it has not, open a new ticket and give a description of the new feature you would like to see.

#### Documentation or Code Contributions ####

If you are interested in contributing documentation or code changes, the project generally uses the [GitHub Flow](https://githubflow.github.io/) branching workflow and accepts contributions via Pull Requests.

The basic steps for working with GitHub Flow is as follows:

  * Go to the [FarmData2 Repository] (the _upstream_)
  * Fork the _upstream_ repository to your GitHub (the _origin_).
  * [Clone] the _origin_ repository to your local machine.
  * Set the  _upstream_ remote for your local repository to point to the _upstream_ repository.
  * Create a _feature branch_ from the _main_ branch your local machine.
  * Make the edits to the documentation or the code in your _feature branch_.
  * Commit your edits.
    * If the contribution reflects the work of multiple people, ensure that
    everyone receives attribution by [Creating a commit with multiple authors].
  * Pull the most recent _upstream_ version of the _main branch_.
  * Merge the update _main branch_ into your _feature branch_.
  * Push your _feature branch_ to the _origin_.
  * Make a Pull Request for your _feature branch_ to the _upstream_.
