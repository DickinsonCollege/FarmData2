# FarmData2 Configuration Module

The FarmData2 Configuration Module provides a centralized place to set configuration options that are specific to the FarmData2 features. Underlying farmOS features are still configured through the standard farmOS configuration mechanisms (See: [farmOS User Guide](https://v1.farmos.org/guide/)).
