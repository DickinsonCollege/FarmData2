    <p>FarmData2 modules often make use of local storage to cache commonly used information (e.g. lists of all crops or areas). It can take a few moments to retrieve this data from the server, paticularly if it is also processing other requests.  Thus, caching them in local storage allows the pages load and run more quickly.  This page gives an example of how to cache the list of crops.</p>

    <p>You may notice that the first time the page loads there is a short delay before the list of crops appears.  This is because it is being requested from the server and we must wait for the response before displaying the crop list. If you then reload the page, the crop list will appear instantly because it has been cached.  Clicking the "Clear the Cache" button and reloading will cause the delay to occur again.</p>
